    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p><em>A smooth creamy chocolate cake. Rich <strong>cocoa</strong> smells and flavors will tantalize your friends and family in just 8 quick steps!</em></p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¾ cups (220g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups (300g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup (65g) unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup (240ml) whole milk</li>
        <li>½ cup (120ml) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup (240ml) boiling water</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Oven:
        Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans or line them with parchment paper.</li>

        <li>Prepare Dry Ingredients:
        In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>

        <li>Mix Wet Ingredients:
        In another bowl, beat the eggs, then add the milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract. Mix well.</li>

        <li>Combine Ingredients:
        Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Stir in the boiling water until the batter is smooth (the batter will be thin, but that's okay).</li>

        <li>Bake:
        Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>

        <li>Cool:
        Let the cakes cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>

        <li>Prepare Frosting:
        In a medium bowl, beat the softened butter until creamy. Gradually add the cocoa powder and powdered sugar, mixing well after each addition. Add the salt, vanilla extract, and heavy cream. Beat until smooth and creamy. Add more cream if needed to reach your desired consistency.</li>

        <li>Frost and Serve:
        Once the cakes are completely cooled, spread a layer of frosting on top of one cake layer, place the second layer on top, and frost the entire cake.</li>
